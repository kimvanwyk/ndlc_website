The North Durban Lions Club was chartered in 1967, and has been serving the communities in and around Durban North, La Lucia, Umhlanga and the like ever since. Like all Lions clubs our members are dedicated to the service of those in need, through a variety of projects and fundraising initiatives.

Our club is part of [District 410E](https://lions410e.org.za/) and is one of the more than 14500 Lions clubs across the globe that make up [Lions Clubs International](https://lionsclubs.org).
