Like all Lions clubs, North Durban Lions’ mission is to serve our community. We operate a variety of community service projects, some of which are regularly done and some which are once-off or infrequent.

# Highlighted Projects

## Food Project
Every month, members of the club collect food from the public at several local supermarkets. Collections are done at the Crescent Pick ‘n Pay on the first or last Saturday morning of every month. In addition, Lion Phil Meyer collects at the Kensington Square Spar several times every month. The club gratefully thanks all the supermarkets and shopping centres which allow us to do our collections.

For each collection, the public are asked to donate non-perishable food. All the collected food is stored by the club, and used to make up food parcels. Every month more than 120 single-person parcels  are made up. Several larger family sized parcels are also made up. This is the contents of a typical parcel:

More than 100 parcels are distributed monthly to needy and destitute pensioners at low-cost TAFTA homes. In addition several larger parcels are provided to a few families and orphanages.

[Bagtech International](http://www.bagtechint.com) makes an extremely generous monthly donation to our food project, which aids the club in helping many more people than they would otherwise be able to do.

Golden Hours School
Golden Hours is a school for children with intellectual disabilities. The North Durban Lions’ have had a long relationship with the school, and have made many contributions to the school over the years. We also operate our major weekly fundraiser at the market which the school arranges every Sunday – more details can be found at our fundraising page.

Bambanani
Bambanani is a project designed to teach job skills to young jobseekers. For 6 months, the program provides skills training in general maintenance and related work to several candidates. It also provides training on work ethics, responsibility and general life skills to the candidates. While they are part of the program, candidates receive a stipend, generously funded by various donors.

Hearing
The club  works with an Audiologist, Lauren Glossop, who generously gives of her time to assist in providing hearing screening tests for the hard of hearing. The club pays for moulds and hearing tests for many of those who are found to need a hearing aid, for which Lauren charges a reduced fee. The club also has a stock of donated hearing aids, which are reworked and given to those who need one. Donations of old hearing aids from the public are always welcome.

Sight
The club subsidises spectacle prescriptions through the fantastic Lions Operation BrightSight. We also collect old spectacles from the public, mainly through a collection box at our stall at the Golden Hours Market. Donations of old spectacles from the public are always welcomed. These old spectacles are sent to Lions Operation BrightSight in Benoni, where they are recycled to provide spectacles for those in need.

Donations to Babies Homes
The club makes regular donations towards the Sinakakele and Little Lambs homes for abandoned babies, assisting them financially and with a food parcel.

Donations Towards a Guide Dog
The club has made several donations of R10 000 to the South African Guide Dogs Association for the Blind to aid in providing a guide dog to someone in need.
