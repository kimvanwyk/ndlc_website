The North Durban Lions club will have the delicious 1kg Lions Christmas cakes available towards the end of October. They’ve been carefully baked to the recipe that has been used for many years, so you can be sure of their quality and taste.

The cost is R125 for a 1kg uniced Christmas fruit cake, which contains no alcohol. As with all funds raised by any Lions club, all the proceeds of the sale of Lions Christmas Cakes will be used directly for charitable projects. 

Not only will you be getting a truly delicious Christmas cake for your R125, you’ll be making an invaluable charitable contribution as well. The COVID-19 related circumstances of 2020 have left the club with fewer fundraising opportunities than in other years, which in turn means the club is less able to serve people in need. Your purchase of Lions Christmas cakes this year will make an enormous difference to the lives of many of the people we are able to assist.

If you would like to purchase some cakes from the North Durban Club, please fill in the simple form below and you will be contacted ASAP. Your contact details will not be used for any other purpose, only to contact you about a Christmas cake order.

If you’re not in Durban North/La Lucia/Umhlanga or the surrounding areas, your [local Lions club](https://lionsclubs.co.za/clublinks.html) will almost certainly be selling cakes as well.
