“Called to Higher Service” is Lions Clubs International’s eloquent and moving phrase for Lions who have passed away.

The North Durban Lions Club honours its members who have laid down to rest and will always cherish their memories.

## The Lions Creed

<center>
A person who achieves success, who lives well, laughs often and loves much; who gains the respect of intelligent people and the love of little children.

Who fills a niche and accomplishes his or her task,
who leaves the world better than he or she found it
whether by a brighter flower, a perfect poem, or a rescued soul.

Who always sees the best in others and gives the best he or she has; whose life is an inspiration, whose memory is a benediction.

That person is a LION.
