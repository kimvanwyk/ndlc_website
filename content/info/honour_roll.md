Several past and current members of the North Durban Lions club have been honoured by the club or the District for their long-standing and dedicated service to those in need. This page lists awards and recognition which members have received.

## Lion of the Year
Every year, the outgoing club president makes several awards to recognise the hard work of many of the club members during their year in office. In addition to these awards, a member is also recognised as the “Lion of the Year”, with a plaque and recognition for their particularly strong contribution to the clubs successes for the year.

## Melvin Jones Fellowship

The Melvin Jones Fellowship honours Melvin Jones, the founder of Lions Clubs International. It is the highest form of recognition conferred by the foundation. It is largely due to the growth of the fellowship program that LCIF has been able to meet humanitarian needs in communities worldwide. In many cases these needs are reflected in the eyes of disadvantaged children, or perhaps made apparent by a common sense of hopelessness shared by the elderly whose community has been unable to care for them. LCIF continually meets needs such as these through the generosity of Lions, and others, who have contributed towards the Melvin Jones Fellowship Program. The names of all Melvin Jones Fellows are electronically shown in continuous rotation in the LCIF Recognition Room at Lions International Headquarters. This exhibit stands as a tribute to a growing network of individuals who are committed to the humanitarian objectives of LCIF.

On several occasions, members who have rendered outstanding service have been made Melvin Jones Fellows by the club or the District in recognition of their service:
