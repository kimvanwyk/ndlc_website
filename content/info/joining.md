Membership of a Lions club is by invitation only. If you are interested in finding out more about the club and maybe becoming a member, please [contact us](/info/contact) and you will be invited to come along to one of our meetings or projects where you can find out what we do.

The club is always looking for new members to assist in serving the community. New members are inducted at a short but special induction ceremony. 

The club has some operating expenses which it needs to cover. The club is also expected to pay a fee per member to the District, Multiple District and International organisation. As all money raised from the public is used for charitable purposes, members are charged a membership fee which is used to provide the funds to administer the club, District, Multiple District and International organisation.

Any fees expected to be paid by members are explained in detail when a new member expresses an interest in joining the club.

Membership fees need not be paid in a lump sum at the start of the year, but can be paid in monthly payments or under any number of arrangements which may suit the member and the club respectively.
