The North Durban Lions club is raffling a queen-szied hand made one-of-a-kind quilt, prepared by the members of the Quilters-By-The-Sea quilting group. Each raffle ticket will cost R10.

By taking tickets in the quilt raffle, youâ€™ll be making an invaluable charitable contribution as well. The COVID-19 related circumstances of 2020 have left the club with fewer fundraising opportunities than in other years, which in turn means the club is less able to serve people in need. Your support will make an enormous difference to the lives of many of the people we are able to assist.

If you would like to purchase tickets from the North Durban Club, please fill in the simple form below and you will be contacted ASAP. Your contact details will not be used for any other purpose, only to contact you about quilt raffle tickets.

We are also planning to make an online payment facility available as soon as possible.
